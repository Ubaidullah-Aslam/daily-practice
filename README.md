# Daily LeetCode Practice

Welcome to my Daily LeetCode Practice repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository is a collection of daily coding challenges from LeetCode that I've been practicing since October 2023. Each day, I add a new Java solution file to the repository, named according to the day and date.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into packages based on the year, month, and week of the challenge. Each Java file contains both the problem statement with examples and a solution in Java. The file naming convention is as follows:

```
com.leetcode.dailypractice.yearYY.month.weekX.SolutionDayMMDD.java
```

## Example:

```
com.leetcode.dailypractice.year23.dec.week1.SolutionFriday1201.java
```

## Contents

Each solution file includes:

- **Problem Statement:** A detailed description of the problem, including examples and constraints.
- **Attached Links:** Links to the original problem on LeetCode for reference.
- **Best Solution:** A reference to the best-known solution available online.
- **My Solution:** My own solution to the problem.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them for your own learning. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please create an issue or submit a pull request. Happy coding!

## Directory Structure

- **com.leetcode.dailypractice.yearYY.month.weekX**
