 * 75. Sort Colors
 * <p>

 * Companies
 * Hint
 * <p>
 * Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
 * <p>
 * We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
 * <p>
 * You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [2,0,1]
 * Output: [0,1,2]
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 300
 * nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?
